# Early Dementia Detection Framework

## An Integrated Technological Framework for Early Dementia Detection: Combining Communication Analysis, Security Protocols, and Machine Learning

## üìã Overview

This project implements a comprehensive framework for early dementia detection using multiple data sources and machine learning techniques. The system combines clinical assessment, voice analysis, and sleep pattern monitoring to provide a holistic approach to dementia risk assessment.

Our framework offers a hierarchical security system, interactive visualizations, and automated reporting capabilities, making it accessible to patients, caregivers, clinical staff, and administrators.

## üîç Research Background

Dementia represents a significant global health challenge affecting over 50 million individuals worldwide, with projections suggesting an increase to 152 million by 2050. Early detection is crucial for timely intervention and effective management strategies.

Traditional diagnostic methods (neuropsychological assessments, neuroimaging) are often time-consuming, expensive, and require specialized expertise. Our research explores a novel approach by analyzing communication patterns, sleep data, and implementing advanced security protocols.
